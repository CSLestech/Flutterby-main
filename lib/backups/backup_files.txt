To back up your main app files, you can do the following:

1. Copy these files to the backups folder before making changes:
   - prediction_details_screen.dart
   - home_view.dart
   - main.dart
   - about_page.dart
   - help_page.dart
   - history_page.dart
   - Any other .dart files in the lib folder

2. For restoring:
   - Simply copy the desired file from the backups folder back to its original location
   - Remember to restart the Flutter app after restoring files

3. The new files we created can be deleted if reverting:
   - utils/bounding_box_painter.dart
   - utils/analysis_visualizer.dart
   
Backup completed on: [DATE]

Note: This backup approach allows you to switch between the original and enhanced versions
of the analysis screen whenever needed.
