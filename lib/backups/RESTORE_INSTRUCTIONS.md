# How to Restore Original Files

This document explains how to revert to the original app code if needed.

## Option 1: Using the Backup Scripts

1. Run `backup_all_files.bat` (Windows) or `backup_all_files.sh` (Linux/Mac) to create full backups
2. The backups will be stored in the `lib/backups` folder
3. To restore, manually copy files from the backups folder to their original locations

## Option 2: Manual Restoration

### To restore the original prediction_details_screen.dart:

1. Copy the content from:
   ```
   lib/backups/prediction_details_screen.dart
   ```
   
2. Paste it into:
   ```
   lib/prediction_details_screen.dart
   ```

### To remove the new utility files:

1. Delete or rename these files:
   ```
   lib/utils/bounding_box_painter.dart
   lib/utils/analysis_visualizer.dart
   ```

## Testing Approach

When testing the enhanced features against the original:

1. Make a full backup first
2. Test the enhanced version
3. If needed, restore files from the backup
4. Restart your Flutter app after any file changes

- `prediction_details_screen.dart` - Added visual analysis with bounding boxes
